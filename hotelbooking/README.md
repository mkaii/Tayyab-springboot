There are 3 main domains - Guest Room Reservations

**Relationships**

- Guest - Room (Many to Many) 
- Room - Reservations (one to Many)
- Guest - Reservations (One to Many )


I've used 3 profiles
- Collections
- jdbctemplate
- jpa 


I've used postgres database to implement jpa, data.sql file is implemented so nothing will be nessassary apart from creating a connection to an empty database and schema called **hoteldb**
